# When They Cross the Line, He Makes Them Pay

## Description

Levon Cade (Jason Statham) just wants a quiet life. A former Royal Marine Commando, he now leads a construction crew and keeps to himself—until the teenage daughter of a close family friend is kidnapped by a brutal Russian trafficking ring. With no patience for red tape or second chances, Levon goes off the grid and into full assault mode, tearing through the criminal underworld to get her back.

What follows is a relentless, high-stakes mission of infiltration, deception, and brutal justice. As Levon dismantles the Bratva’s operation from the inside, the body count rises and the stakes get personal. With ruthless killers closing in and his own daughter in danger, Levon leaves behind the quiet working man and unleashes the soldier he once was.

Directed by David Ayer and co-written with Sylvester Stallone, A Working Man delivers hard-hitting action and raw intensity. It’s a gritty revenge thriller that pulls no punches, where one man wages war against a system that should have known better than to take what he loves.
